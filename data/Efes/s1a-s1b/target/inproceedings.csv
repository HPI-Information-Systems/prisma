The schema definition language is block structured support for one-to-one one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. Provides an inverse mechanism the ability to cluster objects and support for triggers and multiple inheritance.

The added semantics to the E-R such as ISA and maybe-a (with no inclusion constraint) do not have a special effect on the interface. In my opinion visual editing of E-R shema is a sound idea. On the other hand visual editing of queries by copying a subset visual schema may confuse users if the copied subschema containes cycles -- a potential source of the user's misunderstanding. SUPER forces users to break cycles but it is not clear how intuitive this cycle-breaking semantics will be to the user. --- Cha.
